<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am currently doing my Masters in Computer Science in Northeastern University. I am interested on programming and solving challenges. I like Mathematics and also computation part of CS. My main programming language is Java and had done some projects on Core Java. Currently I am working on a project which includes Spring MVC and Hibernate. I worked on MEAN stack, but I wouldnâ€™t say I am expert at it. I also worked as Software Co-Op at MassMutual, where I was introduced a whole new field called Cloud Computing. I worked as a part of small team which followed the core principles of Dev-Ops team. We handled CI/CD process of the project and also worked on deployment of it. We also worked on early design of automated pipeline for CI/CD process.</span></p>
